# Operational Stock

  Operational Stock is a program developed by me and dry as a college assigment during May of 2022. To summarize, the proposal of the assignment was to make a program that obtains data from sales made throghout a period of time as well as data from pre-registered products to determine if and how much should be transferred from storage to the operational center, written in C.
  It was definitely an easier task to make this one, not because the task itself was objectively easier but because while making the previous assignment (Totais de Vendas) I've learned a lot of really useful methods.
